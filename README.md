## ‚ú® **Key Features of Envoy**

- **Open Source from the ground up**: Envoy was built for security professionals by security professionals. However, being open source. Envoy is not limited to just this function.
- **The Brain of Navi**: We all know and love [Navi](https://github.com/SaintsSec/Navi) and if you dont you should. Envoy serves as both its own project and as the brain of Navi.
- **Sponsored by CSI Linux**: We built both Navi and Envoy with guidance of [CSI Linux](https://clilinux.com). As such both will be included in CSI Linux. 

## üöÄ About Envoy  
Springboarding off of advice from multiple people, we have come to one resounding understanding. In order to better secure AI. We need to build it ourselves.
Envoy is SSG's crack at this undertaking. Building from the ground up on PyTorch we intend Envoy to be the main driving AI behind Navi. both of which will be included
within CSI Linux. 
### üåç The Imperative of Open Source in AI & Cybersecurity

In the rapidly evolving domains of AI and cybersecurity, open source stands as a beacon of collaborative innovation. The transparency inherent in open-source projects offers a platform for collective problem-solving, allowing experts from diverse backgrounds to collaboratively tackle complex challenges. This communal approach accelerates advancements and ensures robustness in solutions.

For AI projects like Navi, open source provides an ecosystem where models and techniques are continually refined, reviewed, and validated by the global community. In cybersecurity, transparency is crucial. Open source tools undergo rigorous scrutiny, often leading to more secure and reliable solutions. Adopting an open-source ethos, as Navi has, aligns with the commitment to harness collective intelligence for building secure, efficient, and cutting-edge AI tools.
